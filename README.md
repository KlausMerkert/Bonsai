Bonsai
======

Web based simulation software for teaching computer architecture.

Please refer to the website for more information: [http://bonsai.pinae.net/](http://bonsai.pinae.net/)

Installation instructions
-------------------------

You are free to serve a version of Bonsai from your own webserver. As Bonsai is written entirely in JavaScript there
are no special requirements for the webserver. We tested it with Nginx and Apache but it will most certainly work with
other webservers too. Please see the [angular documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05) if you are
planning to minify the JavaScript. Angular uses variable names for dependency injection and therefore does not allow
renaming of variables during minify.
